# Fastfood-website-Footbridge-fish-chips
This project is a demonstration website for a small business - Footbridge Fish & Chips. It includes home, menu, testimonials, about us and find us pages. Through this project, my knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, and JS was consolidated. And I also learned a lot about file and folder structure, SASS features, responsive design, and debugging on mobile devices.

The layout and color scheme are designed according to their logo and menu.

The responsive design has been made for PC, ipad, and mobile phones.

PC end has some beautiful user interactions

Tech stack: HTML, SASS, and Javascript

Currently, it contains static pages. No database involved. In the future, reservation and order system will be added hopefully.
